# NoteDown
A notetaking app/visual markup language

Try it out [here](https://aneeshdurg.me/NoteDown). Note that the target device
is phones/tablets that have stylus support.

The goal of NoteDown is to provide notetaking features that overcomes the
physical limitations of real paper. NoteDown's novel feature is to treat each
line as a manipulatable object, allowing one to create collapsible lists,
add/delete lines, and move around sections of notes. This bridges a gap between
the ease of manipulation in text editors and the freeform input interface of pen
and paper. 

Eventually the goal of this project is to also introduce notation
that modifies the rendering of the document - aiming to create something that
combines the experience of writing markdown documents and taking real notes.
